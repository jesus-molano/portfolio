      I‚Äôm a 27 years old young man from TenerifeüèñÔ∏è passionate about web
      development, video games and movies. I have been interested in the IT
      world since I was 16 and I love to tinker with computers and change my
      operating system like underpants.

      Not long ago my profession was military. I decided to make a drastic
      change and right now I'm finishing the higher cycle of web application
      design and learning on my own.

      It was a difficult decision to leave behind good colleagues, experiences
      that mark you and a stable salary. But being with my family, my partner
      and my dog Alay is priceless.
