        <p>
          I'm a 28 year old guy from TenerifeüèùÔ∏è passionate about web
          development, videogames and good cinema. I've always been interested
          in the IT world although some time ago I was dedicated to explosives,
          among other things, as a soldierü™ñ in BZAPXVI in Las Palmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself to be loyal, committed to what I set out to do and
          always give the best of myself. I love to keep learning new things and
          keep growing as a professional and as a person.
