# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to my portfolio project. My name is Jesus Molano, and this is where I showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a software developer.

This portfolio project is a web application that serves as an online resume for potential employers or clients to learn more about my work and experience. It features a clean, modern design with easy navigation, and it's built using various technologies such as Astro.js, TypeScript, and Sass.
